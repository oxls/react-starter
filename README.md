**The React Starter** is a good place to start for any React projects.

## How to use

First, you should clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oxls/react-starter.git <yourAppName>
$ cd <yourAppName>
$ npm install
```

You should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "Hello World" in http://127.0.0.1:8080.

From there, you start to develop your own code in the `app` directory.

## Building

If you would like to build, when you finish coding, use `npm run build` or `npm run deploy` to build the static files.
